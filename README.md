# AtliQ Mart Promotion Analysis Project

## Project Overview

AtliQ Mart, a leading retail chain with over 50 supermarkets across southern India, ran significant promotional campaigns during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 festive periods. These promotions were focused on AtliQ-branded products, aiming to boost sales and customer engagement. This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of these promotional campaigns and provide actionable insights to support informed decision-making for future campaigns.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Store Performance Analysis**:
   - Identify the top 10 and bottom 10 stores in terms of Incremental Revenue (IR) generated during the promotions.
   - Analyze store performance variations across cities to uncover patterns or characteristics of high-performing stores.

2. **Promotion Type Analysis**:
   - Determine the top 2 and bottom 2 promotion types based on Incremental Revenue and Incremental Sold Units (ISU).
   - Evaluate the performance of discount-based promotions, such as Buy One Get One Free (BOGOF) and cashback offers.
   - Identify promotions that balance Incremental Sold Units and healthy profit margins.

3. **Product and Category Analysis**:
   - Examine product categories with the highest sales lift during the promotions.
   - Investigate specific products that performed exceptionally well or poorly during the campaigns.
   - Explore correlations between product categories and promotion effectiveness.
